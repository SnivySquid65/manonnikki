hey so you might be wondering why I just have a full copy of a softmare thing
the reason is that I want to use it's file tree as a base, as the likelyhood of one easyrpg game looking the same way is higher than it isn't.
also this has the easyrpg linux player, cuz i use nixos linux, and wine REALLY didn't want to run it.  I should thank bakustarver on github for giving me the link to that file, so I'll link it back to the situation and solution.  https://github.com/bakustarver/rpgmakermlinux-cicpoffs/issues/23

oh yeah and don't forget to install unrar for that
command is unrar x <file>
