# MANONNIKKI
![A screenshot of "MANONNIKKI" in it's starting state.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SnivySquid65/manonnikki/main/manonnikkiThumb.png)

MANONNIKKI is a Yume Nikki fangame created by Shadok, however, in lore, it was created as a collaborative effort between Manon and Cybermare.

## The game
MANONNIKKI plays as a normal EasyRPG game.  However, there are no combat situations, and your only goal is to see all the sights.
It was created using EasyRPG 2003, and is available on itch.io only through a web version.

## This repository
This absolutely does not matter.  In fact, some odd methods were used to get all the assets.  It's mostly an archive as of now, but my goal is to get this working in RPGmaker so I can port it to other platforms, like Windows, Mac, Linux, and maybe even Wii and 3DS ports!

## Usage
If this repository is requested for takedown by Shadok, I'll follow through.
