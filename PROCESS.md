# Ripping Process
The process is simple, really.  But difficulty scales based on how large the game is.  I used Firefox, but there are likely Chromium adjacent features that do the same thing.  

I started up dev tools / inspect element, then selected the "Network" tab.  Then I played through every bit of MANONNIKKI.  Every world, interaction, and stuff.  The files started appearing in the log, and when I was done, I went down the line, and right clicked each one.  I clicked on "Open in new tab" which would open the file and download it.  I did this proccess for every file.  When I was done, I used SOFTMARE_ as a file tree to make it akin to, then I had the first working copy.  It lacked audio, as if you checked issues right now, there is a closed issue mentioning why.  I also hadn't put the "title" image and "system" picture into the correct folders.  But now, it's complete.

This was only put here for those who might want to do something obscure like this in the future =)
